I'm a software engineer who is passionate about making open-source projects, creating technology people can enjoy and cats 🐱. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Angular, ReactJS, ASP.NET, C# and Rust.

Please feel free to clone projects and raise issues if you think something could be better.

Happy coding! 😊
